   <p> Greetings. My name is LaToya Hill, I am what many natives of Nashville consider to be a Transplant, meaning I relocated from another state Alabama by way of Mississippi over 6 years ago and am now considering myself to be from Nashville. I enjoy the limited changing of the seasons as I am a true Southernor and do not fair well to the cold. I am quite found of the variety of festivals, games, concerts and other activities that are always going on here. The most enjoyable scenery here is for me would be the every changing Foodie scene.
   </p>
<p> I am currently employed within Tennessee Valley Healthcare System as a Program Speciliast, in which I verify the credentials of the current staff as well as employeers seekin employment within our healthcare system. The position requires communication with the providers, previous employeers as well as educational facilities to ensure the credentials of the providers are valid.
</p>
<p> I am recently retired from the military having served within the U.S.Army and Mississippi Army National Guard. I've been blessed to travel the world and serve beside wonderful men and women that are as close to me as any family member. I have enjoyed my years of service to country and now it is time to serve my family and self. And in serving myself my intentions are to coomplete this course with a full understanding of all the material covered.
